Steps for setting up a new version of the os
Written by Nick Masso

Download the latest version of raspbian (not raspbian full, not raspbian lite. just plain raspbian)
Flash the onto the medium you are using

download the desktop files from this folder onto a flash drive

insert the flashed media into the pi
connect the pi to a display and keyboard
connect the pi to the internet with an ethernet cord
power on the pi

hit cancel on the window that wants you to set a region etc

open the terminal

verify internet connectivity
$ ping google.com

connect the flash drive
transfer the contents of the flash drive to /home/pi/Desktop
(you can drag and drop, or command line)
sudo cp -r /media/pi/FLASH_DRIVE/. ~/Desktop/

$ cd /home/pi/Desktop
$ chmod +x ./run.sh
$ sudo ./run.sh

roughly 15 minutes into the scripy, you will have to confirm an XRDP screen.
Use the arrow keys to select 'yes' and press enter to continue.

wait a while. get a cup of tea.

after the script is done running and you get your command prompt back, 

$ sudo nano /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
Scroll down and edit the allow_channels setting to say allow_channels=false.
just below that, change the bitmap cache value to false also. update bitmap_cache=false
ctrl+x to exit, press y to confirm

then execute
$ history -r
$ sudo poweroff


Now move back over to your LINUX machine.
take the SD card out of your pi
connect it to your computer

$ lsblk
make sure that your SD card has not been mounted (mount point will be blank)
if it was mounted, unmount all mounted partitions.
$ umount /dev/sdc1
$ umount /dev/sdc2
(replace sdcX with whatever the volume was assigned)

now copy the SD card into a compressed disk image file

you are copying the disk, not a partition on the disk, so 'sdc' will not be followed by a number.
replace /path/to/engr16x_v5_4.img.gz with wherever you want the output file to be saved.

$ sudo dd if=/dev/sdc conv=sync,noerror status=progress bs=64K | gzip -c > /path/to/engr16x_v5_4.img.gz
or if you have pv (pipe viewer) installed and want a fun progress bar
$ sudo dd if=/dev/sdc conv=sync,noerror bs=64K | pv -s 7400M | gzip -c > /path/to/engr16x_v5_4.img.gz

that compressed file now has your image in it. proceed to the "setting up the eOS" document on setup day.
