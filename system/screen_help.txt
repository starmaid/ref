screen
This will open a screen session, create a new window, and start a shell in that window.

Now that you have opened a screen session, you can get a list of commands by typing:
Ctrl+a ?

Starting Named Session
Named sessions are useful when you run multiple screen sessions. To create a named session, run the screen command with the following arguments:

screen -S session_name
Itâ€™s always a good idea to choose a descriptive session name.

Working with Linux Screen Windows
When you start a new screen session, it creates a single window with a shell in it.

You can have multiple windows inside a Screen session.
To create a new window with shell type Ctrl+a c, the first available number from the range 0...9 will be assigned to it.

Below are some most common commands for managing Linux Screen Windows:

Ctrl+a c Create a new window (with shell)
Ctrl+a " List all window
Ctrl+a 0 Switch to window 0 (by number )
Ctrl+a A Rename the current window
Ctrl+a S Split current region horizontally into two regions
Ctrl+a | Split current region vertically into two regions
Ctrl+a tab Switch the input focus to the next region
Ctrl+a Ctrl+a Toggle between the current and previous region
Ctrl+a Q Close all regions but the current one
Ctrl+a X Close the current region

Detach from Linux Screen Session
You can detach from the screen session at any time by typing:

Ctrl+a d
The program running in the screen session will continue to run after you detach from the session.

Reattach to a Linux Screen
To resume your screen session use the following command:

screen -r
In case you have multiple screen sessions running on your machine, you will need to append the screen session ID after the r switch.

To find the session ID list the current running screen sessions with:

screen -ls
